Hi Lisa,

I spoke with Brian Thompson (SSN: 235-66-9012) this morning. He's confirming his appointment for next Thursday at 2:00 PM.
His phone is 212-555-3498 and email: bthompson72@outlook.com. He recently changed his address to 914 Maple Street, Denver, CO 80220.

Also, could you verify if Patricia Nguyen's new insurance policy number 948301LXN9 is updated in the system? Her DOB is 11/25/1978,
and her emergency contact remains her sister, Amy Nguyen, reachable at 303-555-1122.

Reminder: Please follow up with Alejandro Rivera — his background check is still pending. His last known employer was Trident Solutions,
and his tax ID is 88-4321670. His LinkedIn shows an address at 1200 Howard Ave, Apt 4B, Burlingame, CA 94010.

Call logs show a missed message from Emily Dawson, SSN: 610-29-8352, email edawson@fastmail.net. Her medical records (ID 8472910-AD) need to be reviewed.
She mentioned prescriptions filled last month at GoodRx Pharmacy, Invoice #29210.
